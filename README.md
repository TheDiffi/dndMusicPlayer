# Welcome to my D&DMusicPlayer project
Music and Ambiance is a core element to any good D&D session. 
Unnoticed, it has a HUGE impact on the atmosphere in the room and helps to immerse everyone around the table into the game.  Having to painfully look up fitting music online or locally breaks the immersion of everyone involved. 

The Goal of this Project is simplifying playing, pausing and especially switching music down to the press of a single button. 

## Features

Background Music:

- Play/Switch to new Theme by the press of a button
- Songs loop, start automatically and at a random point in the song
- Quickly Play any Music from YouTube by copy pasting the URL into the bar at the bottom

Ambience Music:

- Start/Stop a Song with a single Button
- Play multiple Songs at the same time to create the correct atmosphere
- Playing Songs appear in little windows which can be used to adjust the volume
- Close all ambience with a single "close all" button

Customize registered Songs:

- Add songs found on YouTube to the Program by simply determining a title and copy pasting the URL.
- Delete Songs from the quick selection

## Planned features

Major:

- Soundeffects playable via the quick selection
- Redesign for a less modern look

Minor:

- Make Songnames editable without having to delete it and adding it back in
- Redesign bar at the bottom
