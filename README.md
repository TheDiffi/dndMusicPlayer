Music and Ambiance is a core Element to any good D&D session. 
Unnoticed it has a HUGE impact on the Atmosphere in the room and helps to immerse everyone around the table into the game.

The worst enemy of every game are events which break this immersion. 
Having to painfully look up fitting music online or locally is one of those moments.

The Goal of this Project is to simplify playing, pausing and especially switching music down to the press of a single button.
