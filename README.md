# Welcome to my D&DMusicPlayer project
Music and Ambiance is a core element to any good D&D session. 
Unnoticed, it has a HUGE impact on the atmosphere in the room and helps to immerse everyone around the table into the game.  Having to painfully look up fitting music online or locally breaks the immersion of everyone involved. 

The Goal of this Project is simplifying playing, pausing and especially switching music down to the press of a single button.
